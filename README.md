# CapyPolls

> The First No-Loss Prediction Market with Memecoins, revolutionizing how we make predictions on BNB Chain

## Story & Problem:
Traditional prediction markets face critical issues:
- Users risk losing their entire stake
- No immediate rewards for participation
- Lack of fun and viral elements
- Meme tokens pump and dump without real utility

## Our Solution:
CapyPolls revolutionizes prediction markets through:
1. **No-Loss Innovation**
   - 100% protected USDe stake
   - Cross-chain yield generation via Ethena
   - LayerZero integration for secure bridging

2. **Revolutionary Tokenomics**
   - Instant meme tokens upon participation
   - Winning tokens maintain scarcity
   - Losing tokens face 19x supply inflation
   - Yield-backed token purchasing mechanism

## How It Works:

### 1. Create a Prediction
- Simple social media-like interface
- Set your question and duration
- Create YES/NO meme tokens

### 2. Participate
- Stake USDe (100% protected)
- Receive position-specific meme tokens
- Your stake generates yield through Ethena

### 3. Resolution
- Everyone gets their USDe back
- Winning tokens maintain original supply
- Losing tokens multiply by 19x
- Accumulated yield purchases winning tokens
