# CapyFlow

CapyFlow is creating the next billion onchain trust movement, through innovative crypto stables like USDe.

## Story & Problem:
- Traditional donations often feel disconnected - donors give and hope for the best
- Beneficiaries sometimes need more than just money - they need guidance or services
- Service providers (Collectors) want to help but need sustainable ways to do so

## Our Platform's Trust Triangle:

1. Donors/Creators:
- Create purpose-driven funding pools
- Can set conditions and milestones
- Get real visibility into impact
- Can recommend specific Collectors they trust

2. Beneficiaries:
- Get both funding AND support
- Build relationships, not just receive money
- Have choice in which services they need
- Can show proof of impact to build trust

3. Collectors (Service Providers):
- Offer verified valuable services (education, mentoring, healthcare, legal aid)
- Get sustainable income while helping others
- Build reputation through successful outcomes
- Can specialize in specific types of support

## Real World Examples:
- A medical fund where donors contribute, beneficiaries get treatment, and pre-approved healthcare providers get paid directly
- Education funds where donors support students, and approved tutors/schools can provide services
- Business grants where donors fund entrepreneurs, and business mentors get compensated for guidance

## The Innovation:
We are not just moving money - we are building trust networks that connect those who want to help, those who need help, and those who can provide specialized support.
